# Restaurant-ChatBot
# Overview
 The Restaurant Chatbot is a Python-based conversational interface built using Dialogflow, FastAPI, and MySQL. It allows users to interact with a restaurant's ordering system through natural language conversation. Users can place new orders, add items to existing orders, remove items from orders, and track the status of their orders.
